  <p>My name is Mona ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Born and raised in Japan. Studying Digital Media Art at San Jose State University.
    I used to make pencil/charcoal drawing most, but I’m interested in more digital art such as programming, shooting the video, making a game etc.

    My goal as an artist is to make the art pieces related to the life. Since I feel the beauty to the things which is changing, I want audience to feel what the meaning of life is to them.
