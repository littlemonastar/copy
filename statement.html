      <p>My name is Mona. Studying Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. I made pencil/charcoal drawing most until I started learning art in college and university, but I became interested in more digital art such as net art, shooting videos, and making games since I enrolled in SJSU. I love creating abstract art with sound. My goal until I graduate is to make the abstract art with sound and show about the life I experienced.

        <br>
        My goal as an artist is to make many kinds of videos to make people have fun. It sounds too simple, but it's difficult as well. When I have a hard time, art exists all over the world helped me to keep alive. So, I want to be a part of it this time.
