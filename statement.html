  <p>My name is Monaʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
Born and raised in Japan. Moved to the US in 2012 as an international student. I've been living in California and studying Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. I'm planning to get a BFA degree of DMA. I studied Mathematics in college at first but changed my major to Art in 2014. I've learned the foundation level studio art and art history in the college and University. I have experience in working at interior design company. Also, I have a background in working as a sushi chef/assistant manager. I could enhance my knowledge of food preparation/design skills, besides, management skills through the experience.

I'm very addicted to creative activities/music so I hope I could share my favorite things through this website/twitter/Youtube channel etc. with everyone :) <3
Thanks for visiting!
