  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>The things I create are related to the culture or religion where I was born. I was born in Japan and Shinto or Buddhism influence me a lot even though I do not have strong religious devotion. I like being silent, sitting down in nature, and thinking about life and death. If I said "thinking about death", some people may think it sounds negative or sad. However, it is not a bad thing for me to think about death. It makes me feel the connection to the universe. Have you ever thought about where are you going after your death? What would remain after your body disappears?

I believe our consciousness is important because our consciousness remains in a space like a universe and will be infused at the moment when new life is born. So, I've taken a notion of consciousness habitually and tried not to think about the things I care about during meditation. I just focus on what comes to my mind such as the scene of ocean, forest, or stream.
