    I create a video collecting the sound of food/drink. I made this because not only I just like the sound, but also the sound is important when making people hungry and be curious.

    </p>
    <p>
    Based on the word "cow cash" I came up with this idea. I regarded the pattern of the cow as a child working in child labor and collaged the money that will fall forever from it. I think that people who think child labor is surely good think children are only as eternal tools and can be used as "material" which will generate money. And the second one represented people who are pleased without knowing the source of the money.

    <p>"Aha Experience!", website, 2019
    </p>
    <p>
    "Aha Experience!" I wanted to make a little game for final project. I thought making this game is gonna be a good review for using a technique I learned of photoshop, editing video, and also html/css. This game was popular in my country Japan almost 10 years ago and I don't know if it's really helping nerves of our brains activate, but I think it's fun anyway to find the difference.
