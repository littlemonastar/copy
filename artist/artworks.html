    1. #Wasted / 2018 / Short Movie<br><br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZbvigF48S4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    It is all about social media addiction. I use Instagram as everyone does, but am sometimes worried about people who only cares the photos. They want to take a photo of food with good quality, but don't care its taste. They want to take self portrait like model, but don't care people around them even though they bother. People are too much on their phone while they are sitting together at restaurant.
    <br><br><br>
    2. The Difference / 2019 / Stop Motion Animation<br><br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpRe1W2GdNo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br><br>
    This is a simple message that we should accept the difference. When we face a situation that we have never experienced before, we tend to avoid seeing the truth or accepting something new like not only appearance but also the behavior or culture. Before we judge and act, we should consider how others see their world and feel what you would do.

    3. A Map to Get Lost / 2018 <br><br>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipr0UMOQorY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <br><br>
    This project is from ART 2 and I created my own map inspired by a quote from Yoko Ono "A map to get lost". Life is a series of choices. We seem to make an average of 70 choices a day. The choice can be wrong or correct. I think that people might get lost when they are looking at the graph of a lifetime and wonder if what was correct. This is what this video shows.

<h2 id="third">Zen Garden Meditation</h2>

<a href="https://colossal-pot.surge.sh/">WebGL ver is here</a><br>

My artwork Zen Garden Meditation is a space to meditate. Due to the pandemic situation, we tend to stay in the same place. I like to meditate, but I find it difficult to switch feelings because I stay in the room all day. I created a virtual space to make me feel like I am in a different space. I decided to use Karesan-Sui, known as Zen Garden, to make it a space that interweaves my culture.
<br><br>
I also prepared a VR space so that you can experience a more realistic space. I don't think most people have a VR headset, so you'll have fun on browser.<br>

  1. The Moment / found object/oil cray / 15*5*10 cm<br><br>
  <img src="dma_images/car.jpg" alt="car" width="280" height="240"><br><br>
  This is a found-object remake project from ART 2. I represent the moment when I had a car accident. The mixed clay represents my feelings and memories at that time. I cut the plastic into pieces and made it looked like glass shards.<br>
  <br><br><br>
  2. Talisman Project / bronze/patita / 15 cm<br><br>
  <img src="dma_images/tas.jpg" alt="talisman" width="240" height="240"><br><br>
  The snake is a symbol of longevity, and this leaf in the center is the crest of my house. I created it with the hope of family health, peace, and good luck.<br>
  <br><br>
  3. The Airborne　/ ceramic / 50*25*20 cm<br><br>
  <img src="dma_images/pubg.jpg" alt="pubg" width="280" height="240"><br><br>
  These ceramic objects were made in ART 68 class. I made things on my theme using various techniques. At that time, I was absorbed in the FPS game called PUBG, so I made a box of air supplies, a bag, and a pan, which are items that came out of the game.
  <br><br>
  4. Eggs　/ ceramic / 10*10*18 cm each<br><br>
  <img src="dma_images/egg.jpg" alt="egg" width="280" height="240"><br><br>
  This was the first project made with art68. The eggs on the left were designed inspired by Egyptian murals. The egg on the right is painted in jet black, giving a simple and mysterious atmosphere.
