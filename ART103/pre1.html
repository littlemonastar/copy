            This is a portrait of my friends who works as an artist in LA. I drew this when I started studying art in college. He asked me to draw him so I chose the medium that I was really into at that time.<br>

            This video is about how people are obsessed with taking a good picture more than eating or enjoying the moments that they are having. I often see people focus on how they would be seen by others on SNS. They show how they enjoy their lives by posting high quality/ photoshopped pictures on Instagram. I was inspired by the news there are some cases that youngers toss the food out after they took a picture.  <br>

            The Accident/found object<br>

            I made this object in the art 2 class. I represented the moment when I got a car accident 2 years ago. I flipped over twice and it was the scariest experience in my life. I've thought I was dead when I lost control of my car. <br>
