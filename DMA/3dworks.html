          1. The Moment / found object/oil cray / 15*5*10 cm<br><br>
          <img src="dma_images/car.jpg" alt="car"><br><br>
          This is a found-object remake project from ART 2. I represent the moment when I had a car accident. The mixed clay represents my feelings and memories at that time. I cut the plastic into pieces and made it looked like glass shards.<br>
          <br><br><br>
          2. Talisman Project / bronze/patita / 15 cm<br><br>
          <img src="dma_images/tas.jpg" alt="talisman"><br><br>
          The snake is a symbol of longevity, and this leaf in the center is the crest of my house. I created it with the hope of family health, peace, and good luck.<br>
          <br><br>
          3. The Airborne　/ ceramic / 50*25*20 cm<br><br>
          <img src="dma_images/pubg.jpg" alt="pubg"><br><br>
          These ceramic objects were made in ART 68 class. I made things on my theme using various techniques. At that time, I was absorbed in the FPS game called PUBG, so I made a box of air supplies, a bag, and a pan, which are items that came out of the game.
          <br><br>
          4. Eggs　/ ceramic / 10*10*18 cm each<br><br>
          <img src="dma_images/egg.jpg" alt="egg"><br><br>
          This was the first project made with art68. The eggs on the left were designed inspired by Egyptian murals. The egg on the right is painted in jet black, giving a simple and mysterious atmosphere.
