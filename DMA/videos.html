          1. #Wasted / 2018 / Short Movie<br><br>

          It is all about social media addiction. I use Instagram as everyone does, but am sometimes worried about people who only cares the photos. They want to take a photo of food with good quality, but don't care its taste. They want to take self portrait like model, but don't care people around them even though they bother. People are too much on their phone while they are sitting together at restaurant.

          2. The Difference / 2019 / Stop Motion Animation<br><br>

          This is a simple message that we should accept the difference. When we face a situation that we have never experienced before, we tend to avoid seeing the truth or accepting something new like not only appearance but also the behavior or culture. Before we judge and act, we should consider how others see their world and feel what you would do.
